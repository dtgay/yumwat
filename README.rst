Wild card! Oddshocks writes a yum plugin!

Wat
---

When I use yum to update my system or install new packages, I sometimes spot a
package I am unfamiliar with, such as the ``mesa-dri-filesystem`` package I saw
the other day. In some graphical extensions of yum, a brief discription of the
package is listed under each package name. I figured I'd check out some docs on
writing yum plugins, to see if I could display a description under each package
name in the CLI updater. Then the Internet was like, "Yo, each yum plugin is a
single file, written in the Python programming language", and after I cleaned
up my brain which had EXPLODED out of my HEAD I made this repo and now we are
on a science adventure.

Installing
----------

Installation is easy! From the project directory (where this file is),
do the following.

Shell Script
************

I have written a bit of a shell script that does the above installation
for you. It is ``install.sh``, and will probably require root privs, like
so: ``sudo ./install.sh``. Currently, it does not do step 3 below,
so make sure to do that yourself.

Manual Installation
*******************

1.  Install the plugin file: ``sudo cp yumwat.py /usr/lib/yum-plugins/``

2.  Install the plugin's configuration file: ``sudo cp yumwat.conf
    /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/``

3.  Add the line ``pluginpath=/usr/lib/yum-plugins`` to the file
    ``/etc/yum.conf``.

Enabling and Disabling
----------------------

Shell Scripts
*************

Running ``sudo ./enable.sh`` or ``sudo ./disable.sh`` will enable or disable
the plugin, respectively, however **they will do this by overwriting your
config file**, so if you have customizations, take the manual route, below.

Manually flipping the switch
****************************

You can disable yumwat without uninstalling it by opening
``/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/yumwat.conf`` with a text editor and changing the line
``enabled=1`` to ``enabled=0``. To enable the plugin, simply make sure that
the line reads, ``enabled=1``.

Uninstalling
------------

Easier than installation! We just need to make sure you remove the
generated bytecode file, too:

1.  Remove the configuration file: ``sudo rm /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/yumwat.conf``

2.  Remove the plugin file and its generated bytecode: ``sudo rm
    /usr/lib/yum-plugins/yumwat.py*``

Currently, the shell script cannot uninstall for you.
